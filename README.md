# 🚀 VisionSpec-QC
## Automated PCB Defect Detection using Computer Vision & Deep Learning
### 📌 Overview

VisionSpec-QC is a Computer Vision & Machine Learning project developed to automate PCB (Printed Circuit Board) quality inspection.

The system classifies PCB images into:

✅ PASS

❌ DEFECT

It also integrates Explainable AI (Grad-CAM) to visualize defect regions and improve model interpretability.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Manual PCB inspection is time-consuming, inconsistent, and error-prone.
This project provides an AI-powered automated solution to improve accuracy, efficiency, and reliability in manufacturing quality control.
